# Sales Analysis Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing product sales to specific clients over the past two years. Using SQL queries and Power BI, I tracked the sales of different products by salespeople to different customers, and created a dashboard to showcase the results.

The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface to visualize and explore the sales data over time. Users can filter the data by product, customer, and salesperson to gain insights into their performance. Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive charts and graphs to help identify trends and patterns in the data.

This project also includes the SQL scripts used to query the data, as well as the Power BI file used to create the dashboard. The code is stored in the repository along with the dashboard and can be easily accessed and modified by anyone who wants to build on this project.
